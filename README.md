Dynamic Pictures
================

Draws snakes made out of "light," and shows them bouncing around the 
screen.  

Instructions
------------
Download the .jar (or get the source and compile it yourself) - you 
should be able to just double-click on it and have it start.  

Most of the snakes will do their own thing; however, one will track 
your mouse.  Left-click to speed it up, right-click to slow it down.  
Middle-click (click with both left and right buttons if you don't have 
a dedicated button) to make that snake stop tracking you, and again to 
restart the tracking.  

Have fun!
